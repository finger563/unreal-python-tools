# Python Tools for Unreal Engine 5

Some python libraries and scripts for interfacing with Unreal Engine 5, the
plugins I've made, as well as the data they produce.

Currently useful for interfacing with:
- [Camera Capture Component](https://github.com/finger563/unreal-camera-capture)
- [RTSP Display](https://github.com/finger563/unreal-rtsp-display)
